1. We need to calculate the total cost of all the developer salaries in a single company.
2. Boss comes to our office and says that we need a different calculation for the
   Senior and Junior developers. 
   The Senior developers should have a bonus of 20% on a salary.
   => Even though this solution is going to give us the correct result, this is not an optimal solution.
3. Better salary calculator example - OCP implemented.
